/**
 * \page designpatterns Design Patterns and Idioms
 *
 * A design pattern is a generalized reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem
 * within a given software design context. Leveraging design patterns can
 * speed up development by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
 *
 * One of the goals of MonkeyHammer was to create a utility that, when given a
 * design pattern would automatically spit out the properly formatted source code
 * implementation in each of the target computer languages, complete with
 * unit tests (if necessary).  This greatly simplifies the tedious process
 * of writing code and can hopefully allow us to focus on design and not
 * practice our typing skills.
 *
 * With great power comes great responsibility.
