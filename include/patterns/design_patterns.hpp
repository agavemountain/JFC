 * \brief Design Patterns and Idioms
 *
 * A design pattern is a generalized reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem
 * within a given software design context. Leveraging design patterns can
 * speed up development by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
 *
 * While the design pattern fad may have passed, there are still some very useful
 * design idioms out there.
